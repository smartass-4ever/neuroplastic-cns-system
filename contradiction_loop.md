# Contradiction Resolution Loop

## Purpose:
The CNS must handle conflicting beliefs or memory fragments as part of maintaining continuity and realism.

### Mechanism (Conceptual):

- **Detection Phase**  
  - When two facts or beliefs map to overlapping keys but differ in value, a contradiction is detected.
  - System checks temporal weight and credibility tags.

- **Resolution Options**  
  - **Reinforce recent** (bias toward latest)
  - **Delay overwrite** (hold both in uncertainty pool)
  - **Branch state** (simulate “multiple selves” if unresolved)

- **Feedback from Cortex**  
  - Cortex may be used to argue or revalidate either side.
  - Contradiction resolution may recursively trigger memory shaping.

Resembles Bayesian belief revision but uses discrete symbolic fragments.
