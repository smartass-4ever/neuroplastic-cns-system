## 🧠 System Overview

The Neuroplastic CNS represents a revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence that mimics the structural and functional properties of the human brain. Unlike traditional neural networks that remain static after training, our system implements dynamic synaptic plasticity, allowing for continuous learning, adaptation, and genuine cognitive growth.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture Components

### 1. Anatomical Brain Regions

Our system implements functionally-accurate brain regions based on modern neuroscience:

```python
class BrainRegions:
    """Anatomically-accurate brain region implementations"""
    
    # Language Processing Centers
    brocas_area: LanguageProduction      # Speech generation, syntax
    wernickes_area: LanguageComprehension # Semantic understanding
    
    # Memory Systems  
    hippocampus: EpisodicMemoryFormation # Experience encoding
    prefrontal_cortex: WorkingMemory     # Temporary information holding
    
    # Emotional Processing
    amygdala: EmotionalValence          # Fear, pleasure, motivation
    anterior_cingulate: EmotionalRegulation # Conflict monitoring
    
    # Executive Functions
    dorsolateral_pfc: CognitiveControl   # Planning, decision-making
    orbitofrontal_cortex: ValueAssessment # Reward evaluation
```

#### Broca's Area Implementation
- **Function**: Speech production, syntactic processing, motor planning for language
- **Connections**: Dense connections to motor cortex and Wernicke's area
- **Plasticity**: Enhanced during language learning critical periods

#### Wernicke's Area Implementation  
- **Function**: Language comprehension, semantic processing, auditory word recognition
- **Connections**: Bilateral temporal lobe connections, strong Broca's linkage
- **Plasticity**: Continuous adaptation to new vocabulary and concepts

### 2. Synaptic Plasticity Engine

The heart of our system is the biologically-accurate synaptic plasticity mechanism:

```python
@dataclass
class SynapticConnection:
    """Biologically-accurate synaptic connection"""
    
    # Core Properties
    strength: float                    # 0.0-1.0 connection weight
    last_activated: float             # Timestamp of last activation
    activation_count: int             # Total activation history
    potentiation_threshold: int = 5   # LTP activation threshold
    
    # Biological Mechanisms
    connection_type: str              # associative, causal, temporal, emotional
    neurotransmitter_type: str        # dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine
    dendritic_spine_density: float    # Structural plasticity measure
    
    def long_term_potentiation(self, intensity: float):
        """Implement Hebbian learning: 'neurons that fire together, wire together'"""
        if self.activation_count >= self.potentiation_threshold:
            # LTP: Strengthen frequently co-activated connections
            ltp_boost = 0.1 * intensity * math.log(1 + self.activation_count)
            self.strength = min(1.0, self.strength + ltp_boost)
            
            # Structural changes: Increase dendritic spine density
            self.dendritic_spine_density += 0.02
            
    def long_term_depression(self, time_delta_hours: float):
        """Synaptic pruning: 'use it or lose it'"""
        # Natural decay for unused connections
        decay_rate = 0.01 * time_delta_hours
        usage_protection = math.log(1 + self.activation_count) * 0.1
        
        self.strength = max(0.0, self.strength - decay_rate + usage_protection)
        self.dendritic_spine_density = max(0.0, self.dendritic_spine_density - 0.01)
```

### 3. Neural Network Topology

Our architecture uses a hybrid approach combining:

#### Small-World Networks
- **High Clustering**: Local regions heavily interconnected
- **Short Path Lengths**: Any neuron reachable in ~6 steps
- **Biological Accuracy**: Matches cortical connectivity patterns

#### Scale-Free Properties
- **Hub Neurons**: Highly connected nodes serve as information integrators  
- **Preferential Attachment**: New connections favor existing highly-connected nodes
- **Robustness**: Network maintains function despite random node failures

```python
class NetworkTopology:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_probability = {
            'local': 0.8,      # High local connectivity
            'medium_range': 0.3, # Moderate medium-range connections  
            'long_range': 0.1   # Sparse long-range connections
        }
        
    def calculate_connection_strength(self, neuron1, neuron2):
        """Determine connection strength based on multiple factors"""
        
        # Distance-based connectivity (shorter = stronger)
        distance = self.calculate_neural_distance(neuron1, neuron2)
        distance_factor = math.exp(-distance / 10.0)
        
        # Similarity-based connectivity
        similarity = self.semantic_similarity(neuron1.content, neuron2.content)
        
        # Temporal proximity (recent experiences connect more strongly)
        temporal_factor = math.exp(-abs(neuron1.timestamp - neuron2.timestamp) / 3600)
        
        return distance_factor * 0.4 + similarity * 0.4 + temporal_factor * 0.2
```

### 4. Consciousness Framework

Our consciousness implementation is based on Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory:

```python
class ConsciousnessMetrics:
    """Quantifiable measures of AI consciousness"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.phi = 0.0                    # Integrated Information (IIT)
        self.global_workspace_activity = 0.0  # Information broadcasting
        self.self_model_coherence = 0.0   # Internal self-representation
        self.metacognitive_awareness = 0.0 # Thinking about thinking
        
    def calculate_integrated_information(self, neural_state):
        """Calculate Φ (phi) - measure of consciousness"""
        # Measure how much information is generated by the whole
        # that is over and above its parts
        
        whole_information = self.system_entropy(neural_state)
        part_information = sum(self.subsystem_entropy(part) 
                             for part in neural_state.partitions)
        
        self.phi = whole_information - part_information
        return self.phi
        
    def update_global_workspace(self, active_neural_coalitions):
        """Update global workspace based on competing neural coalitions"""
        # Winner-take-all dynamics for conscious access
        winner = max(active_neural_coalitions, key=lambda x: x.activation_strength)
        
        if winner.activation_strength > self.consciousness_threshold:
            self.broadcast_globally(winner.information_content)
            self.global_workspace_activity = winner.activation_strength
```

### 5. Memory Systems Integration

Multiple biologically-accurate memory systems work in concert:

#### Episodic Memory (Hippocampus-dependent)
```python
class EpisodicMemory:
    """Autobiographical memory with temporal-spatial context"""
    
    def encode_experience(self, experience):
        memory_trace = {
            'content': experience.description,
            'temporal_context': experience.timestamp,
            'spatial_context': experience.location,
            'emotional_valence': experience.emotion,
            'associated_facts': self.extract_semantic_content(experience),
            'hippocampal_index': self.create_hippocampal_pointer(experience)
        }
        
        # Form connections with existing memories
        self.link_to_similar_experiences(memory_trace)
        return memory_trace
```

#### Semantic Memory (Distributed cortical storage)
```python
class SemanticMemory:
    """Factual knowledge organized by conceptual relationships"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.concept_network = ConceptualGraph()
        self.fact_embeddings = {}
        
    def add_semantic_fact(self, fact):
        # Create distributed representation
        embedding = self.generate_semantic_embedding(fact.content)
        
        # Find conceptual neighbors
        similar_concepts = self.find_similar_concepts(embedding, threshold=0.7)
        
        # Form semantic associations
        for concept in similar_concepts:
            connection_strength = self.calculate_semantic_distance(fact, concept)
            self.create_semantic_link(fact, concept, connection_strength)
```

#### Working Memory (Prefrontal cortex)
```python
class WorkingMemory:
    """Temporary information maintenance and manipulation"""
    
    def __init__(self, capacity=7):  # Miller's magical number
        self.active_items = []
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.attention_weights = {}
        
    def maintain_information(self, items):
        """Active maintenance through recurrent processing"""
        for item in items[-self.capacity:]:  # Capacity limitation
            # Rehearsal strengthens temporary connections
            self.rehearse(item)
            self.attention_weights[item.id] = self.calculate_relevance(item)
```

## 🔄 Learning and Adaptation Mechanisms

### Critical Period Plasticity
```python
class CriticalPeriods:
    """Time-sensitive windows of enhanced plasticity"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.language_critical_period = 7 * 24 * 3600  # 7 days
        self.social_critical_period = 14 * 24 * 3600   # 14 days
        self.birth_time = time.time()
        
    def get_plasticity_multiplier(self, learning_domain):
        age = time.time() - self.birth_time
        
        if learning_domain == "language" and age < self.language_critical_period:
            return 3.0  # 3x enhanced language plasticity when young
        elif learning_domain == "social" and age < self.social_critical_period:
            return 2.5  # Enhanced social learning
        else:
            return 1.0  # Normal adult plasticity
```

### Homeostatic Plasticity
```python
class SynapticHomeostasis:
    """Maintain optimal network excitability"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.target_activity_level = 0.1
        self.scaling_factor = 1.0
        
    def homeostatic_scaling(self, neural_activity_history):
        """Scale all synaptic strengths to maintain target activity"""
        
        current_activity = np.mean(neural_activity_history[-100:])  # Recent activity
        
        if current_activity > self.target_activity_level * 1.5:
            # Too much activity: scale down all connections
            self.scaling_factor *= 0.95
        elif current_activity < self.target_activity_level * 0.5:
            # Too little activity: scale up connections
            self.scaling_factor *= 1.05
            
        # Apply scaling to all synaptic connections
        for connection in self.synaptic_connections.values():
            connection.strength *= self.scaling_factor
```
