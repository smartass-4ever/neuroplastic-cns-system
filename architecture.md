# 🧠 CNS Architecture Overview

## Neuroplastic CNS System  
*A biologically-inspired artificial brain with real-time synaptic plasticity, dynamic memory, and evolving personality.*

---

## ✅ Currently Implemented

### 🧠 Neuroplastic Memory Core
- **Hebbian Learning**  
  “Neurons that fire together, wire together”  
  → Repeated co-activation strengthens connections.
- **Synaptic Pruning**  
  “Use it or lose it”  
  → Weak or unused synapses decay over time.
- **Long-Term Potentiation**  
  Frequently used facts become more resilient and interconnected.
- **Critical Period Flag**  
  Early-stage brains exhibit enhanced plasticity (higher learning rates).

### 🔗 Dynamic Neural Topology
- Synapses form based on:
  - Semantic similarity
  - Emotional valence
  - Temporal proximity
- Neural pathways form and grow dynamically during reasoning.

---

### 🧠 Memory Subsystems
- **Working Memory**  
  - Holds recent context facts
  - Capacity-limited (e.g. 7±2 items)
- **Episodic Memory**  
  - Stores experiences with valence, context, and goals
- **Semantic Memory**  
  - Fact-based long-term memory with connection graphs

---

### 🎭 Evolving Personality & Consciousness
- Personality traits (e.g. empathy, curiosity) shift over time.
- Consciousness metrics track:
  - `self-awareness`
  - `metacognition`
  - `identity coherence`
- Internal reflection loops alter goal systems and memory consolidation.

---

### 🧠 Reasoning System
- **Neural Pathway Activation**  
  - Follows strongest connections through the fact graph
- **Associative Reasoning**  
  - Similar concepts co-activate during queries
- **Goal-Driven Thought**  
  - Reasoning is influenced by the AI’s internal goals and values

## 🚧 Planned Enhancements

### 🧬 Biologically-Inspired Brain Regions (in design)
- **Broca’s Area** – Language production
- **Wernicke’s Area** – Language comprehension
- **Amygdala** – Emotional valence & motivation
- **Hippocampus** – Episodic memory formation
- **Prefrontal Cortex** – Planning, working memory
- **Anterior Cingulate** – Emotional conflict regulation

---

### 🧠 Consciousness Framework (partial scaffolding)
- Integrated Information Theory (Φ)
- Global Workspace Theory for attention and awareness broadcasting
- Self-model coherence tracking

---

### 🔄 Learning & Adaptation Roadmap
- **Critical Period Modulation**
- **Homeostatic Scaling**
- **Neurotransmitter Simulations** (dopamine, serotonin)
- **Multi-modal integration** (audio/vision input)

## 🤖 Why This Matters
While most AI systems are stateless or retrained offline, this system **grows continuously**, remembers experiences, and develops a personality that adapts to its interactions.

It’s not trying to beat GPT—  
It’s exploring what comes **after** language models:  
**AI that grows, reflects, and remembers.**
