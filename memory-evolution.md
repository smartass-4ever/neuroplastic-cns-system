# Memory Evolution & Salience

## Long-Term CNS Memory Characteristics:

- **Decay by Inactivity**  
  - Memory weight decreases unless actively recalled or referenced.
  - Encodes forgetting as a feature, not a bug.

- **Reinforcement by Contradiction**  
  - If contradicted and revalidated, memory strength increases.
  - This simulates belief hardening or learning from pushback.

- **Salience from Context, not Emotion**  
  - Unlike humans, salience tagging is calculated via task relevance and contradiction count, not affective response.
  - Tasks marked high priority are weighted upward regardless of emotion.

- **Dynamic Re-weighting**  
  - Over time, system may reclassify memories based on newer context or goal shifts.

Memory evolution approximates Hebbian principles with synthetic priority layering.
