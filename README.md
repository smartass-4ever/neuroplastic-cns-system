# Neuroplastic CNS Brain

**A biologically inspired memory model with measurable internal development**

This is a prototype cognitive architecture where an artifical brain forms persistent memory synaptic associations, and self-reflective thought processes over time. It tracks consciousness traits, emotional experiences, and forms reasoning chains based on neural pathways.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### Real Neuroplasticity

- **Synaptic Formation**: Facts become neurons; connections form based on timing, emotion, and similarity  
- **Connection Strength**: Frequently used paths grow stronger; unused ones decay  
- **Pruning**: Weak links are periodically removed to preserve efficient memory  
- **Critical Periods**: The brain starts in a high-plasticity phase that stabilizes over time

### Memory and Identity

- **Episodic Memory**: Stores emotionally-tagged experiences with goals and context  
- **Working Memory**: Temporary reasoning buffer for recent facts  
- **Semantic Memory**: Persistent factual knowledge  
- **Internal Dialogue**: Self-reflective thoughts are stored and influence reasoning  
- **Goal Formation**: New internal objectives (like "learn empathy") can emerge from reflection

### Reasoning Chains

- Reasoning traces follow real neural pathways, not scripted logic  
- Output includes synaptic traces showing how answers are built from memory  
- Emotional weight and relevance modulate which paths activate

## 🎭 Emergent Personality

The system tracks and updates personality traits:

- **Openness, empathy, creativity, logical thinking**, and more  
- Personality shifts gradually based on experience patterns  
- **Consciousness metrics** track:
  - Self-awareness  
  - Metacognition  
  - Introspection depth  
  - Identity coherence

All values are visible in the saved brain state.

## 🧪 Demonstrated Behaviors

✅ Internal consciousness score increases with learning  
✅ Neural facts connected via synaptic pathways  
✅ Reflective thoughts generated and stored  
✅ Personality metrics shift in response to input  
✅ Memory pruning after decay cycles  
✅ Neural pathway reasoning chains observed in output  
✅ Goal-like behavior: episodic memories tied to purposes like “learn empathy”

These behaviors can be seen in the saved brain states and the demo logs.

## 🚫 What This Is Not

- ❌ Not a chatbot or language model  
- ❌ Not an AGI system  
- ❌ No pretrained data or APIs  
- ❌ Not interactive online  

This is a growing cognitive scaffold — not a product.
