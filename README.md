neuroplastic CNS

A synthetic central nervous system built from first principles ‚Äî inspired by evolutionary biology, not statistical shortcuts.

We are not building another chatbot.  
We are building a living, learning, **modular cognition system** with long-term plasticity, contradiction resolution, and memory prioritization ‚Äî the kind of structure evolution favors over brute-force token prediction.

ü§ñ Why Not Just Use AGI?
Most LLMs:

Recompute from scratch every time
Forget everything afterward
Don‚Äôt form persistent inner structures
Have no evolving internal state
We believe a synthetic CNS, with layered plasticity and embodied structure, will scale better than stateless AGI.

## üß† What It Is

This project is a **neuroplastic CNS architecture** with an embedded LLM cortex.

It is:
- **Not AGI**
- **Not humanlike**
- **Not another wrapper**

Instead, it's a dynamic brain-like system that:
- Encodes and forgets memories based on *utility*
- Builds a persistent internal self
- Interfaces with an LLM like a cortex, not like a command oracle
- Evolves over time through reinforcement, contradiction, and task-based relevance

## üîç Core Principles

1. **Neuroplastic Memory**
   - Facts are stored with dynamic importance
   - Contradictions cause memory reshaping
   - Low-utility knowledge decays over time

2. **Cognitive Modularity**
   - Cortex = LLM API
   - Limbic = memory router
   - Reflex loop = contradiction detector
   - Metacognitive loop = internal dialogue

3. **Non-Emotional Efficiency**
   - No emotional salience
   - Importance is measured purely by goal utility and task relevance

4. **Identity Drift**
   - Personality and perspective shift over time
   - No static system prompt
   - Behavior shaped by history, contradiction, and reinforcement

## üöß Current Status

This repo is **not yet open-source**.  
We are:
- Testing memory decay, contradiction handling, and cortex/CNS routing
- Tuning self-reflection and goal-directed recall
- Designing synthetic personality drift over time

Public updates coming soon.  
Code may be released later under a custom or limited license.

## üß¨ Built From First Principles

This project is based on:
- Evolutionary design pressure
- Nervous system modeling
- Self-updating knowledge graphs
- LLM reasoning, but not LLM memory

We‚Äôre not simulating humans.  
We‚Äôre trying to build something that thinks **better**.
